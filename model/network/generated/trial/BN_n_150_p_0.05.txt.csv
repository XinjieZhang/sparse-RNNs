FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: D:\My Code\Python_code\universal structural patterns in SNN\model\network\generated\trial\BN_n_150_p_0.05.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 150
Number of edges: 1099
Number of single edges: 1063
Number of mutual edges: 36
Number of edge colors: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with globally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

14841 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
14998918 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
15013759 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 4119246 tries were made, 3159747 were successful.
Randomization took 4.207 seconds.
Enumeration took 7.96 seconds.
